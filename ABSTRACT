Crowd control is a vital component of public safety, particularly in high-traffic places like transit hubs, shopping malls, stadiums, and public events. Traditional crowd monitoring systems frequently rely on manual observation or costly infrastructure changes, which are inefficient and resource intensive. This project presents an AI-driven system that utilizes the current CCTV network for real-time crowd analysis and management via machine learning (ML).
The YOLOv8 model, a sophisticated object detection algorithm, is used to identify individuals in video streams and analyse crowd density, movement patterns, and potential abnormalities. Its lightweight architecture allows real-time processing with precision, making it suitable for large-scale deployment without significant hardware investments. The technology combines computer vision and deep learning for actionable insights.
The project aims to improve public safety and urban management by integrating AI and computer vision with existing security infrastructure. It involves capturing live CCTV footage, preprocessing video frames, and applying YOLOv8 for object detection and tracking. Heatmaps and flow analysis are used to monitor crowd dynamics, and an alert system is implemented. The system enhances situational awareness, improves emergency response times, and optimizes crowd distribution strategies, while addressing privacy and ethical concerns.
